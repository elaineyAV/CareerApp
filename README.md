# Job Fair Note App

## Vision Statement

For students attending job fairs who need an efficient way to take, organize, and analyze notes about companies they meet, the Job Fair Note App is a command-line application with user-friendly front end that helps users capture company details, compare opportunities, and track follow-ups all in one place. Unlike traditional pen-and-paper notes or generic note apps, our product provides structured data entry and company insights tailored specifically for job fair preparation and post-event evaluation.

**Note**: The initial implementation is a console application to meet project technical requirements (Java + Apache Ant). Future versions may include a mobile interface.

## Project Overview

This project applies software engineering principles to develop the Job Fair Note App:

- **Development Methodology**: Kanban/Agile workflow for flexible, iterative development
- **Stakeholder Management**: Structured communication, planning, and documentation practices
- **Team Collaboration**: Established norms, code review processes, and contribution tracking

The project follows professional software development practices with comprehensive documentation, user stories, and regular retrospectives.
