### Future Development: Mobile Application
**Timeline**: Post-project (2026+)

The console application establishes the core functionality and data model. Future development could include:
- Mobile app interface (Android/iOS)
- Web-based interface
- Cloud synchronization
- Enhanced analytics and insights

This approach allows us to focus on functionality first with the current technical constraints (Java + Ant), then expand to mobile platforms later.

## Risk Management

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-------------|------------|
| Incomplete objectives documentation | **Critical** | Medium | Templates in place, early completion, Nov 18 buffer |
| Team member unavailability | **High** | Medium | Cross-training, clear ownership, pair programming |
| Technical blockers | **Medium** | Medium | Early research, leverage instructor support |
| Scope creep | **Medium** | High | Strict adherence to prioritized backlog |
| Testing delays | **Medium** | Medium | Write tests alongside code, not after |
| Integration challenges | **Medium** | Medium | Incremental integration, continuous testing |

**Key Milestone**: Nov 21 objectives documentation is a hard deadline. Product development timeline is flexible and extends through December.
