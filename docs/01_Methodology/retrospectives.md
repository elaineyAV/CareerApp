# Retrospectives

## Purpose

Regular team retrospectives to reflect on our process and continuously improve. These are internal team meetings, separate from stakeholder reviews.

**Schedule**: Every 2 weeks throughout the project

**Focus**:
- What went well
- What didn't go well  
- What we learned
- Actions to improve

## Retrospective #1: Planning Phase Review

**Date**: November 12, 2025  
**Attendees**: Elaine, Giorgina, Jaiden, Ubi, Sayo  
**Context**: Continuing planning

### What Went Well ✅
- Everyone was present in person
- We all agreed to the team agreement
- Felt good about framework for user stories and acceptance criteria

### What Didn't Go Well ⚠️
- Not sure what to do about what the minimum a user could test would be (iteration 0)
- Next step clear but steps after that not clear
- Assigning tasks is a weak point

### What We Learned 💡
- Need to be really clear about who is doing what
- Need to be realistic about what we can do as an iteration 0

### Action Items 🎯
