# Development Methodology

## Why We Chose Kanban

For the Job Fair Note App project, we selected **Kanban** as our development methodology. Here's why:

### 1. Flexibility
- We can adapt to changing priorities without rigid sprint boundaries
- Accommodates our varying academic schedules
- Allows us to adjust scope as we learn more about the requirements

### 2. Continuous Delivery
- We can deliver features as they're completed
- No waiting for artificial sprint boundaries

### 3. Visual Workflow
- Easy to see what everyone is working on
- Clear view of bottlenecks
- Simple to use with GitHub Projects

### 4. Focus Through WIP Limits
- Encourages finishing work before starting new tasks
- Prevents team members from being overloaded
- Improves code quality by reducing context-switching

### 5. Right for This Project
- Less overhead for documentation-focused work
- Flexible workflow as we develop understanding and artifacts
- Easy to visualize progress through documentation phases
- Continuous flow as we create and refine deliverables

## Our Kanban Board

**We use GitHub Projects** to visualize our Kanban workflow.

📋 **GitHub Project**: [Mindful Makers Kanban Board](https://github.com/orgs/Mindful-Makers/projects/5/views/1)

### Board Columns

1. **Backlog** - All user stories and tasks waiting to be prioritized
2. **Ready** - Stories and/or tasks that are refined and ready to work on
3. **In Progress** - Active development (WIP limit: 3 items)
4. **Review** - Code review and testing (WIP limit: 2 items)
5. **Done** - Completed and merged

User stories are tracked as **GitHub Issues** and linked to the project board.

### Work-in-Progress (WIP) Limits

| Column | WIP Limit | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| In Progress | 3 | Encourages focus on completing work; prevents overload |
| Review | 2 | Prevents review bottleneck; promotes timely feedback |

**Note**: With 4-5 team members, these limits ensure we finish work before starting too many new items. Limits can be adjusted based on what we observe in practice.

### Definition of Done

A story is "Done" when:
- [ ] Code is written and works
- [ ] Regression tests are written and pass
- [ ] Code review is complete with approval
- [ ] Code is merged to main
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are met

## Why Not Other Methodologies?

### Why Not Scrum?
- Documentation work doesn't fit neatly into sprint cycles
- Sprint ceremonies would be overhead for our team size and timeline

### Why Not Waterfall?
- Need iterative refinement, not one-time delivery
- Waterfall doesn't accommodate learning and adaptation
