## Team Dynamics

**What worked well:**
- Everyone had strengths that contributed to shaping the project in a way that I don't think that our deliverable could have taken form this way without each other.

**Challenges:**
- It was difficult to get everyone together at the same time due to conflicting schedules. Collaboration went well when we were able to get together but could get spotty outside of class. 

**How we could improve:**
- We tried very frequent check-ins then dialed down when it felt like too much. Maybe another option might be setting expectations and deadlines while together, then checking in when needed. That might offer more flexibility for a group that felt very time-strained.
